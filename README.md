# Design-of-pll-based-clock-and-data-recovery-circuits
In serial communication of digital data, clock recovery is the process of extracting timing information from a serial data stream to allow the receiving circuit to decode the transmitted symbols. Clock recovery from the data stream is expedited by modifying the transmitted data. Wherever a serial communication channel does not transmit the clock signal along with the data stream, the clock must be regenerated at the receiver, using the timing information from the data stream.
